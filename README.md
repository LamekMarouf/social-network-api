# Social Network API

## Description

This is a social network API that uses mongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js and Express.js to create a database that stores information of users and their thoughts. To begin with, the "npm install" command needs to be ran to install all necessary packages. Following this step, the "npm run seed" and "npm run start" command need to be ran in order to seed the data and run the server. You can then use an app, such as Insomnia, to test CRUD operations and see how this project works.
